# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a meeting scheduling backend system built with ASP.NET Core using Clean Architecture principles. The system enables scheduling meetings for multiple users while automatically detecting and preventing scheduling conflicts. The solution must find the earliest available time slots that work for all participants within specified business hours.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create users in the system, so that they can participate in scheduled meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid user creation request is submitted THEN the system SHALL create a new user with a unique identifier
2. WHEN a user creation request contains a name THEN the system SHALL store the user with that name
3. WHEN a user creation request is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN a user is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the user details including the assigned ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a meeting organizer, I want to schedule meetings for multiple participants, so that I can find the earliest available conflict-free time slot for all attendees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a meeting scheduling request is submitted with participant IDs, duration, and time constraints THEN the system SHALL find the earliest available time slot that works for all participants
2. WHEN participants have existing meetings THEN the system SHALL ensure no overlapping meetings are scheduled
3. WHEN no available time slot exists within the specified constraints THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a valid time slot is found THEN the system SHALL create the meeting and return the scheduled time details
5. WHEN the requested time falls outside business hours (09:00-17:00 UTC) THEN the system SHALL only consider slots within business hours
6. WHEN a meeting duration would extend beyond business hours THEN the system SHALL not schedule the meeting in that slot

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my scheduled meetings, so that I can see my calendar and upcoming commitments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their meetings THEN the system SHALL return all meetings where they are a participant
2. WHEN a user has no scheduled meetings THEN the system SHALL return an empty list
3. WHEN an invalid user ID is provided THEN the system SHALL return a not found error
4. WHEN meetings are returned THEN the system SHALL include meeting details such as participants, start time, and end time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system, I want to enforce business rules and data integrity, so that the meeting scheduling system maintains consistency and prevents invalid states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a meeting is created THEN the system SHALL ensure the start time is before the end time
2. WHEN checking for conflicts THEN the system SHALL prevent any overlapping meetings for the same user
3. WHEN validating meeting times THEN the system SHALL ensure meetings fall within business hours (09:00-17:00 UTC)
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL validate all required input parameters
5. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for bad requests, 404 for not found)
6. WHEN back-to-back meetings are scheduled THEN the system SHALL allow meetings that end exactly when another begins

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow Clean Architecture principles, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and follows separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers
2. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL keep all business rules within the Domain layer
3. WHEN implementing data access THEN the system SHALL use repository patterns with interfaces in the Application layer
4. WHEN implementing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL use CQRS pattern with separate commands and queries
5. WHEN returning data from APIs THEN the system SHALL return DTOs rather than domain entities
6. WHEN handling cross-cutting concerns THEN the system SHALL implement proper logging with Serilog and structured logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that the system behavior is verified and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing domain logic THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for all business rules and invariants
2. WHEN testing the scheduling algorithm THEN the system SHALL have tests covering normal cases, edge cases, and no-availability scenarios
3. WHEN testing CQRS handlers THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for all commands and queries
4. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL have integration tests for user creation, meeting scheduling, and meeting retrieval
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL have tests for validation failures and not-found cases
